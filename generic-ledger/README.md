# Context

The company wants to develop an internal ledger to track internal incomes and expenses.

We then began developing a ledger system to reach that goal.

# Before you begin

Each following feature requests are purposedly generic, it will be your choice to define what is acceptable and satisfactory.

# Request 1

You are given the following wireframes from and asked to implement the first version of the ledger:

* [Figma Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/nKWXLyJd1kxMC0AnPGiWHl/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)

For the prototype, use the data in the [data.json file](./data.json)

# Request 2

Accounting now would like to be able to understand the current status of the ledger.
Add the computation logic of the ledger total amount and display it on the FE (Where to display that info is left to you and your sense of UI/UX)

# Request 3

Our stakeholders want to be able to add a entries in the ledger by themselves.
Implement a solution (DB, Backend, Frontend included), placement and design is left up to you.

# Request 4

For reporting reasons, accounting would like to be able to export the ledger in CSV format,
add the ability to allow us to download that file (generation logic is left to you).

# Request 5

Our Business development team wants us to be able to track not only one but MULTIPLE ledgers at the same time.
Add an ability to generate and display multiple ledgers.
